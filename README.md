Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

As seen in the first chart below, if Pewlett Hackard were to just pull from the list of eligable mentors. They would not beable to fill the rolls now avaliable. 

In order to midigate department wide down sizinging the pool of eligable employees up for promotion need to include those born between 1961 and 15. As seen in the the second chart.

Although this is only a 10 year solution. After which based on the last chart. They will not have enough internal employees to fill the open postions.
